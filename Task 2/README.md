## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the portfolio website locally.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd "C:\Users\IMAFIDON EMMANUEL\Desktop\HNG\Task 2"
    ```
    (Or the directory where you cloned the project.)

3.  **Open in Browser**:
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by dragging it into an open browser window.
    *   For a more local server experience (optional, but good practice for web projects), you can use a simple Python HTTP server:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        # For Python 2
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
        Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

This portfolio is a static website designed to be straightforward to use and explore.

*   **Navigation**: Use the links in the navigation bar (`Profile`, `About Me`, `Contact`) to switch between sections of the portfolio.
*   **Contact Form**:
    *   Go to the "Contact" section.
    *   Fill in your "Full Name", "Email Address", "Subject", and "Message".
    *   The form includes basic client-side validation for all fields (e.g., valid email format, message length).
    *   Click "Send Message". A success message will appear if all fields are valid.
*   **Social Links**: On the "Profile" page, click the "Connect With Me" links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Instagram) to visit my social profiles.
*   **Profile Time Display**: The profile card on the "Profile" page displays the current time in milliseconds, which updates dynamically.
